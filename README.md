### 👨‍💻 About Me

After 10 years troubleshooting HVAC systems, I made the leap to software engineering. Turns out debugging broken code isn't so different from diagnosing a faulty compressor - just better hours and climate control.

**General Assembly Bootcamp Graduate (Nov 2024 - Mar 2025)**  
Currently finishing my AA at Santiago Canyon College, transferring to CSUF in 2026 for my CS degree.

**What I'm Building:**
- 🏢 Backend infrastructure for Elaview (B2B SaaS marketing platform with AI-powered analytics)
- 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 Family product showcase website with admin dashboard
- 💼 Portfolio site to showcase my transition story

**What I'm Looking For:**
Junior developer roles, internships, or freelance opportunities in Orange County or remote

**When I'm Not Coding:**
- ⌨️ Mechanical keyboard enthusiast
- ⚾ Baseball coach for my son's team
- 🔧 Still helping friends with their AC units occasionally
